 NAME:
      MaxD_Gram

 DESCRIPTION:
Extracts end members from a spectral image using the MaxD approach.  Also estimates the
Material diversity in a scene using the Gram matrix approach, both global and local.

TO CALL:
   endmembers, endmembers_index, volume = maximumDistance(data, num, mnf_data, gram)

 USES:
numpy

 PARAMETERS:
    data = 2D data [npixels, nbands]
    num = number of endmembers to be calculated (choose more than expected to find)
    mnf_data = [MNF data cube or 0]; if MNF data is not available (i.e., mnf_data = 0),
        code will assign img as mnf_data

 KEYWORDS:


 RETURNS:
maximumDistance -  endmembers, endmembers_index, volume
calcGram; calcGramLocal - gram (Grammian, the volume of the parallelotope enclosed by the end members)

 NOTES:
- original python code developed by Tania Kleynhans based on papers by Amanda Ziemann and Dave Messinger

 HISTORY:
08/30/2023 - created
11/19/2025 - updated with argmax and argmin due to minimum distance endmembers returning multiple indices
